# QA Engineer / L3 support engineer

## Location

San Francisco

## Responsibilities

Gandi.net is looking for a QA Engineer. Sitting in between our devops and customer care team, you are comfortable with modern development practices such as continuous integration, test driven development, and want to help us improve our current development and integration methods.

## Desired characteristics

You have a great understanding of our products and technologies, and a past experience in software development. Looking into last-level escalation issues, having access to our codebase and development tools, you can dig into customer issues, find the root cause, and suggest bugfixes, method changes, or add the missing test where it should exist.

You are not afraid to send a pull request for a major quick win, or to fix a major customer deceptive path.

In the meantime, you're helping us make it easy for you to push and test that fix into production.

Working on improving our customer experience also concerns developer use cases, and you'll easily spot bad designs and push towards better abstractions and a smoother experience within our products.

## Get in touch

If you think you cover more than 80% of that description, feel free to contact us as usjobs@gandi.net to discuss this around a beer.
