# Awesome QA and Devops engineers

## Location

FIXME: Paris or SF?

## Responsibilities and desired characteristics

You are fluent in Python, also passionate about new languages and technologies, like to design APIs, work on customer use cases and product improvements. You probably also love low-level stuff, kernel hacking or system analysis - or you have another favorite specialty.
You've mastered, by necessity or curiosity, some combination of puppet (which we use in production), chef, ansible, docker, fig, and friends. 

## About Gandi

We manage 1.5M+ domains for our customers, who can also spawn xen, kvm, and cgroup containers using our APIs, and benefit from many domain-related features. We have a 800+ systems production environment, a few datacenters around the world, with the usual suspects (linux hosts, virtualization, load balancers, mitigation, routers, switches, squirrels).

We're growing the team, and need to work on deployment and integration methods, help our engineers ship fixes and features within our products faster. You can be one of those engineers, or you can facilitate their work from closer to the customer care team (QA engineer), or somewhere in between.
