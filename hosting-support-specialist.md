## About 

If Linux is your passion, and you want a job where you can dig into the practical aspects of Linux-based hosting, we have a job for you!
Gandi is expanding, and looking for smart, fresh, inquisitive people who love a challenge. Our hosting team is a collection of innovative collaborators, who love helping our customers get the most out of Gandiâ€™s systems. If you like to find the answers to questions about networking, DNS, disk volume management, virtual networking, and other advanced hosting use cases, please apply now.

While Gandi can train you in the particular aspects of our systems (and we know that no one does things quite like us!), we do need you to know something about networking and Linux administration when you join. At a minimum, you should be familiar with:

* Linux system administration 
* Network interface configuration
* DNS zone files
* Protocols like HTTP(S) / SSH / FTP / SFTP
* Mail: IMAP, POP, SMTP
* Programming languages (any of): Python, node.js or Ruby would be a plus
